// Array.splice(position_you_want_to_remove, number_of_items_to_remove)

var myFish = ['angel', 'clown', 'mandarin', 'sturgeon'];

myFish.splice(2, 0, 'drum'); // insert 'drum' at 2-index position
// myFish is ["angel", "clown", "drum", "mandarin", "sturgeon"]

myFish.splice(2, 1); // remove 1 item at 2-index position (that is, "drum")
// myFish is ["angel", "clown", "mandarin", "sturgeon"]
